Please, go to the [GUIDE](docs/GUIDE.md) in order to get the instructions for this assignment.

Some ideas for obtaining a :gift: if you are the first that:

- **Test-it**: Provides a JUnit-based validation of the tasks.
- **Other server is possible**: Uses a web server different from Tomcat and uses a JUnit-based test to prove it.
- **Compress-me**: Enables HTTP Response compression and uses a JUnit-based test to prove it.
- **I-like-XML**: Enables content negotiation in `/time` and provides a JUnit-based test to prove it.
- **CORS what?**: Enables [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) support and provides a JUnit-based test to prove it.
- **No more static**: Replace the `error.html` file by a `ControllerAdvice` and provides a JUnit-based test to prove it.
